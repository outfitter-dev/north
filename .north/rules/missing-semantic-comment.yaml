message: "Exported component should have @north-role JSDoc annotation"
rule:
  kind: export_statement
note: |
  Add a JSDoc comment with @north-role to document the component's purpose:

  /**
   * @north-role button variant with loading state
   */
  export function LoadingButton() { ... }

  This helps with codebase documentation and enables better tooling support.
  Only applies to composed components, not primitives or layouts.
