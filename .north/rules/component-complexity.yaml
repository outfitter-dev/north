message: "Component has too many utility classes; consider extracting to composable utilities"
rule:
  kind: jsx_attribute
  has:
    kind: property_identifier
    regex: "^className$"
note: |
  Class count thresholds by context:
  - primitive: 10 classes (strict, should be simple)
  - composed: 15 classes (moderate complexity allowed)
  - layout: 20 classes (more flexibility for layout concerns)

  When a className attribute exceeds these thresholds, consider:
  - Extracting repeated patterns to utility functions
  - Using component variants with cva()
  - Creating semantic wrapper components
