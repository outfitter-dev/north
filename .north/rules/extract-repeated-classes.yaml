message: "Consider extracting repeated class pattern to a reusable utility"
rule:
  kind: string_fragment
note: |
  This rule queries the north index to find class patterns that appear
  frequently across your codebase. Repeated patterns are candidates for:

  - Extracting to a cn() utility function
  - Creating a cva() variant
  - Defining as a design token

  Run 'north index' first to build the pattern index.
  This rule is skipped gracefully if no index exists.
